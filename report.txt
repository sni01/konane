 heuristic 1:count the number of coins that has the player symbol on the board
 heuristic 2:count the number of legal moves that the player has when meet the depth limitation 
 the MinMax Player spends approximately 9m59.124s(10mins) and MinMax winner 4 times and random player winner 6 times
 the AlephaBeta Player spends(using first heuristic), the time spending is approximately 46.650s, and AlephaBeta Player winner 1 times and random player winned 6 times
 the AlephaBeta Player spends(using first heuristic), the time spending is approximately 11m28.296s, and AlephaBeta Player winner 1 times and random player winned 4 times
 it seems that the heuristic 1 cause less time since it only scan the coins number, the heuristic 2 used more time since it checks the legal moves.
 but they all win less times than random player, proved that they are not good heuristic or the heuristic methods do not show the accurate way of victory
 the MinMax and AlphaBeta(heuristic 1) has the similar winning results, show that they are using same heuristic methods and they are only different in speed aspect.
 when change depth from 3 to 2, MinMax player wins 6 times and random player wins 4 times.and the time speeding decreases significantly; for AlphaBeta Player, heuristic1 gets 3 wins and 7 loses, heuristic2 get 0 wins.
 so both of two alphabeta players decrease winning rate after decreasing depth limitation from 3 to 2. But they all decreases time speeding dramatically
