konane
======

A konane test fixture for Spring 2014 Comp 131.

To use simply clone the repo and run:

    python konane.py <args>
    
where the args (including those that control multiplayer and cross-language games) can be found via the standard:

    python konane.py -h

for the multiplayer test fixture.  Of particular note is the fact that you can append a capital letter to the end of the player executable name to switch which AI type is run from that executable.  Additionally,

    python player.py -h

will print the docs for how to invoke the a player for just one turn (handy for debugging).

You'll probably want to edit the player.py file.

This code requires either python 2.6+ or any version of python3.
